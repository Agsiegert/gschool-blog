In my previous life/job I was good at what I did I was successful but I was not happy.  I wasn't challenged and I felt it in every aspect of my life.  It was affecting my mind, my health, my family, my passions. Two years ago I decided I had to make a change.  After a lot of introspection and a ton of research I came across software engineering.  It fit my aptitude, it fit my goals it looked like the life I wanted.  The more I researched the more I liked it.  Until I looked at it 'backwords,' what would it take to get a job.  While there were may options to go back to a traditional school, no companies seemed to be hiring with only those credentials. I would need not only a software engineering degree but also a CS degree and 2-3 years of actual programing on top of that. I came to the realization that, while it would be great, it was too big of a risk to my family's security. 4 more years of school, maybe workign part time and coding on the side wasn't an option. But I could work and save towards that goal.

Fast forward 18 months and I am sitting in the 'loo' reading the news on my iPhone and come across an acticle about Dev Bootcamp. WHOA!!! This is great, this is what I need, I can do that, I can pay that, I could take that time.  But wait its in SF... I cooould do that....  I researched, researched, researched and found two schools in Colorado. Research, Research, Research.  Whoa, I am getting excited I can do this.  While the timing wasn't great to discuss a major life change, I couldn't hold it in.

I told my wife, I know now is not a great time but we need to talk! In hindsight, probably not the best statement to schedule a talk with your wife.  I think I freaked her out a bit and we had the talk right then and there.

I had a lot of detractors, there were plenty of people I talked that thought it was a bad idea for one reason or another.  The most improtant person in my decision making process suprised me the most.  My wife, I thought would be the biggest detractor, yet she has been the most supportive of eveyone.  She has the most to lose if I fail, yet she has been the most supportive... Thank you.  

So, I started the process. It took over a month to complete my application to gSchool. Namely because the video was so hard to do with out screwing it up in one take. I should have spent the time perfecting the editing, it would have been faster. But I decided I could get a 3 minute video in one take and send it in. I submitted the application and waited.
and waited...
and waited...

While I waited I started developing my plan.  I was staying positive, sure a almost 40 father of 2 with little to no programing experience has a chance... What am I going to do if I get in.  I knew it would be 6 months, 60 to 80 hours a week. That is a lot.  I would have to quit my business.  Should I sell it, should I just let it die?  What about daycare?  What about the rental properties? What about the Money?  What about my boys? What about my wife?  While I waited I made plans to put my life on hold for 6 months. BUT, I couldn't do anything about it, what if I don't get in to gSchool? 

So the last week of June came and I go worried and applied to RefractorU in Boulder.  Then I got an email from gSchool setting up an interview!!!  I also got a quick response from RefractorU, setup the interview and was offerd a spot right away.  I was blown away!  This was going to happen, this was going to happen! In the end I was accepted into gSchool as well and after a little deliberation with my wife I accepted the spot at gSchool.

But now I only had 6 weeks until school started and had to get all those plans in place.  

And that is a whole other post...
