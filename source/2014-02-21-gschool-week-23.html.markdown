#Looking#

* **What are the things you're most proud of from your work in the course?**

  Solving problems and knowing where to look for solutions in our projects.  I constantly have to remind myself and look back at where I started with no experience and have come really far.

* **What do you wish you'd done differently?**

  More prework and asked for more help.  We were told not to "fake it till you make it."  I had thought I wasn't faking it but looking back there were plenty of times. I should have stopped and gotten more help to insure I knew what I was doing the entire time. Looking back, hindsight is 20/20.

* **Who has surprised you along the way?**

  Adam, was my biggest surprise.  I felt he and I were at the same level up to about Christmas break and since returning from break I have been utterly amazed at his ability and confidence. Looking good, Kudos.

* **If you could choose to work with one person from our class for the next two years, who would it be? Why? Who would choose you?**

  I wish I could continue to work with each and everyone in the class.  I have learned so much from eveyone in class and have enjoyed my work and interactions.

* **How are you going to continue learning once you're in your job?**

  First I want to repeat all the tutorials from class.  Next read all the books I didn't have time for during class.  Finally, looking for open source and fun projects to practice building other things regularly.
