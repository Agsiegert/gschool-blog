<H1><b>Week 3</b></H1>

  Wow what a week!  Each time I get discouraged my mantra has been "compare what I know today to what I knew the day before gSchool!"  The amount of knowledge gained has been amazing. I started CodeYear and tried to complete the program through Codecademy in 2012.  Between running my business, working and family I didn't complete much.  By the end of last week at gSchool, I had basically learned more than I had form 2012 to September 8th, 2013, Wow.

<H3><b> Retrospective </b></H3>

  <b>How was working in a pair for over a week? Did you feel like you were twice as productive? What was harder and what was easier?</b>

  This project was great for pairing, I was assigned to a pair who was close to my ability and we were able to work together.  we shared driving duties, used ScreenHero and worked fairly well together. I say <i>fairly</i> because we are still novices and I have a tendancy to make changes and forget because we moved to something else.  Also, I like to 'just put stuff on the screen' to think about it and get it out of my brain...  I wouldn't say we were twice as productive but definitley 1 and half or 3/4.  Overall it was easier as we could bounce ideas off each other and one of us seemed to know what code to write in most instances.  if we both were stumped it was validating and we then knew it was time to ask for help.

  <b>You're now four weeks into the program. Have you mastered more or less than you would have predicted? Why?</b>

  I came into the program not knowing much of any programing.  I hadn't used a Mac since College and had only a little knowledge of the process.  I knew that after 6 months I would be a proficient web app developer and that was why I came. Without an expectation I had no prediction other than an outcome. The first four weeks have been rough, with a huge learning curve. My expectations grew and I really stressed out that I was not following along, that I should be getting this and I was failing.  I stessed out so bad that I broke out in hives, which has never happened before.  I finally relaxed when I realised I was putting the pressure on myself.  This is not a traditional school.  We are here to learn and that is the most improtant thing.  Turning in projects, test etc are not important at this stage.  Knowing that made all the difference.  I coud break things, I could work on my projects with no fear. No fear that if I broke something and could not fix it, it was okay.  The project isn't "due" its to be worked on and where you get is where you get, no worries. I progressed alot without the stress and knowing it didnt matter if I broke it cause I could use that broken project to learn more and not worry so much about a final outcome.  I have a lot to learn, I know this and I work hard to learn each day.  

  <b>If you had to guess now, where are your skills going to be in five months? What will you intend to do after the program?</b>

  They keep telling me I am on the right track, I will get this and be successful in the program.  I have been told this by all the instructor and by the students of the last classes which I have met.  That is all I need right now to know I will get it and have a successful outcome.  After the program my intention has always been to <i>get a job</i>. My idea of wha the job might be is changing and I am not yet fully sure.  As I learn more and network I know it will become more clear.  Once again, no worries.

  <b>What learning strategies are working best for you so far? Why?</b>
