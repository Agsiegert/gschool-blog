*About focus as individuals and as a group*

* **What are you focused on learning over the coming three weeks?**

  Its hard to use the word focus with my current plan of attack.  I am trying to expand my breadth of knowledge through the project and learning about breaking apart services for our app. But I need to continue to build my base and fill in my "Swiss cheese" of a knowledge foundation. To do the later I have started over with rails using a new approach/learning system and it has been very helpful.  The problem with focus is that I am not.  However, I took this course to learn as much as I can and be the best at it along the way.  That goal is yet again not focused.  In my Resume I stated and throughout the course I have said I am drinking from the fire hose of gSchool instruction.  While I have had a good drink but I have left a lot spilled on the floor.

* **What are you focused on achieving?**

  Foundation and breadth (but I am not sure what that means yet.)

* **How do you focus best? What specific tools, techniques, places, or people make it happen?**

  When I am working in a group I focus best when we are all working on the same problem and a goal in mind.  Alone I focus best with no distractions, I listen to Baroque music and try to drown out everything else.  I can make my individual focus more productive with better pomodoros, but have neglected previously due to settling back in taking up so much time.  Now that I have an established routine I plan to work harder at taking those breaks in between.  I need to remind my self to work smarter not harder.

* **Are you building those supports into your day-to-day?**

  With some concentrated effort and great team members it is coming along.

* **What will it look like when you achieve these goals? How will you know they've been achieved?**

  Pulling a user story, and having the confidence in my toolbox that I have the right **tools** and know the **step** to take to get the job done **properly**,  and know that I know it is done **properly**. I would know because there is someone there that knows more than I do and tells me "that's the way I would do it..."
