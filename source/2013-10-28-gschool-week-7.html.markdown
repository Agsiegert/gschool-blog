# Why('s) #

* **What did you learn about your own skills and abilities while working on your own through IdeaBox?**

  Working on my own was a great experience, I was able to go at my own pace and stop when I needed more information without feeling like I was holding someone back or being left behind.  I finished the tutorial portion of the project fairly early with some dedicated and long hours. Once the iterations were complete I stopped to research a few items and *why* I did not quite understand including *Get* and *Post*.  At that point I decided to step away and work on Ruby fundamentals. More practice is needed in this area and the time was well spent.


* **How are you feeling about building web applications? Sinatra?**

  I am happy we are going to be doing one more smaller project to solidify use and understanding before jumping off in to Rails.  This extra time, I hope will be key to a full understanding of the workings, *whys* and use of all the tools and will better correlate to Rails.


* **Were you able to test your application well? Why or why not? Do you think it matters?**

  I spent the last day running through the tutorial. I started with my mentor and continued with Kevin.  It was a good experience but we were only able to get testing for a small portion of the project.  Mostly just the Ruby code and none of the Sinatra.  I am hoping to better understand how to do this and get it done in the new project. I am glad to understand the *why* of testing and the important benefits, just wish I  was better at it...


* **If you could go back to the start of the project last week and do it all again, what would you do differently?**

  *Why* worry about the past, it's done and you gotta keep moving. Overall, I was pretty happy with my progress considering.  I really needed the extra time to catch up on fundamentals and feel it was time well spent.


* **What were your takeaways from Code Retreat on Friday? What did you like and dislike about the process? What would you do differently for the next Code Retreat?**

  Code retreat was a great experience.  I enjoyed pairing with different people on the same problem set.  Each pairing developed different solutions and each pairing allowed me to use different pieces of code I have learned and help develop the solution.  Other times I was better able to under stand *why* something wasn't or wouldn't work, either through experimentation or a great explanation.  The space was okay though it took some getting used to not having some of the comforts I have grown accustom to at Galvanize, both in their services and my *stuff*.


In all the week was really good.  I started reading ["Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby"](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/) and have really enjoyed it.  Once you get past the weirdness of his storytelling the information is fantastic and being about 3/4 through the book I am realizing the weirdness is a key part of the learning process.  His process appears to be timed based to the weight of the code that is being taught.  He tells a story which creates a visual cue for the topic and really helps retain the information.  Its creating the hole and the peg at the same time and has been soooooo helpful in learning.  I am hoping to read it a second time to really solidify it and insure I really know the subject.  Wish I would have read this before gSchool for sure but it was found at a time when I can really appreciate the learning style. Whereas before gSchool I may have only read the first chapter and dismissed it as a was of time...

  Now if only I had about 12 more hours in the day to read, understand the *why's* and study everything I would be set.  Unfortunately that is a non starter and I will have to continue to manage the time I have and learn as much as I can each day.
