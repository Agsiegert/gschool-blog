#Practice#

* **What did you think about the code retreat? How did it feel to work on a problem which, given your time constraint, was unsolvable? What lessons/ideas did you take away?**

  Code retreat was great, it was nice to see a different work space, one which is cohesive (everybody working toward the same goal.) Getting an inside look at a company and feeling the atmosphere and culture of the company was extremely helpful with out the pressure of being in the middle of a job interview.

  Having an unsolvable problem was not the way I looked at Battleship, i thought it would be solvable. As with any coding project, though, it is never finished and can always be improved. Given our constraints, restarting each time, it was a bit frustrating.  Just I we were gaining traction on the problem time would be up and we would ave to start over. Fun but frustrating.  Lessons and take aways were key and typical, *practice practice, practice*.  After using what seemed like very little Ruby for the two weeks of Dinner Dash, it was hard to get back into it and remember everything that was needed. *Practice practice, practice*.


* **What did you learn through Dinner Dash? Do you have any interesting areas of focus as you go into your next project?**

  Dinner Dash was a great project which I have to give props to my teammates. We really worked great together and got a ton done.  When we hit speed bumps it seemed someone was able to help over come the hurdle and get us moving along. Even Me!  The *practice* of working on such a large project really emphasized the need to break it into its parts and get the job done. I was impressed with how compartmentalized the code could be.  While not easy, putting the different parts together went much better than I expected and it made it really easy contribute.

  Areas of focus feels a bit like an oxymoron for me right now as I really feel the need to focus on everything to get more comfortable and proficient with Ruby, Rails and JavaScript. *Practice practice, practice*.


* **How has the week of JavaScript been? What's making sense and what's confusing? What was the most difficult thing you were able to achieve?**

  At first I was really regretting opening my mouth and suggesting Focus Week be focused on JavaScript.  I felt like I had so much more to work on and practice.  Adding another language on top of a shaky structure didn't seem like a great idea.  Additionally, it was my week for a lightening talk, which I would not have as much time to *practice* what I was learning.  I chose my lightening talk subject largely on how I was feeling Monday afternoon about JavaScript, it SUCKS.  It was fun to read about all the frustrations with JavaScript and produce a fun presentation on the subject.  Through my research I was able to learn a lot about the pitfalls and what aspects cause problems with JavaScript.  Definitely, a good learning experience.

  I definitely need more *practice* and luckily have most of next week to do just that due to a holiday.  The usage of JS and all its frameworks and libraries make much more sense and can't wait to add some sparkle.



  I am looking forward to getting a chance to practice all we have learned.  While there will always be a ton to learn I feel like we have been given the foundation of knowledge at this point to become productive developers.  Now it is time to *practice* all we have learned, to put it to use and create. Most Dev camps are finishing up or have finished by this point and I am really happy to have a whole other half of the course to practice all we have learned with support.  I imagine other camps are expected to go out on their own and practice.  That seems really hard and counter productive.  This is the time that bad habits can form and be ingrained.  Important parts can be left out or worked around.  We are in a position to have someone looking over our shoulder and lead us in the right direction for 12 more weeks, which is definitely what sets gSchool and JumstartLabs apart!
