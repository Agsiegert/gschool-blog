* **What did you learn about [Sinatra, SQL, HTML/CSS, the Web/HTTP] during the CloneWars project?**

  Routes would be the biggest topic learned so far. Of course that is besides what these are and do (with the exception of HTML which I had a pretty good grasp on before gSchool.) *following* the routes and understanding how they are called and used really helped to understand the process and programs.


* **What's the most confusing part of the project that you somehow hacked together?**

  Due to the pace of my group the entire project was pretty confusing.  There was a lot of magic that happened as my group was very experienced and had a lot of knowledge.  I was able to *follow* along for the most part but would not have been able to get very far on the project without them.


* **How are you feeling about writing/using feature or acceptance tests?**

  I still have a lot to learn, but I am understanding the concept a lot better after the work-through on Thursday.  Once again learning syntax and discovering all that is possible with the testing modules is what is needed and will come with time, further study and  what *follows*.


* **If you had another week for Clone Wars, what would you build?**

  Better scrapers, I did a lot of manual work to get the application portion of the project done and felt it could have been done more efficiently.  It was hard to not work on the UI of the existing website.  I definitely understood the reasoning of the project requirements to not "bother" but there was a lot that could have been done to improve the site's appearance.  I was really impressed with Meeka, Nikil and Lauren's Framework buildup which allowed them to recreate a new website with scraped data.  Finally, adding or creating a more user friendly editing interface for our project seemed like the next logical step, we had looked into CKeditor and it appeared to be a good next step and would like to *follow* through with adding that API.


* **What was different about working in a three-person group?**

  Giving up control! As I stated earlier, my group was more advanced and I felt like I was just *following* along the entire time.  I contributed when ever I could and was asked but felt like most things took me 10 times as long as it would have taken my partners.  I also didn't understand what was needed to complete the project enough to help direct the work-flow, ideas.  I *followed* along and contributed as I could and feel like I was helpful, though most times I felt I was most helpful just staying out of the way. With saying that A couple times I believe I made comments or observations which helped the group, prevented some extra work and/or running down a rabbit-hole.
