<H3><b>JUST BREATHE</b></H3>
End of the second week!  This has been on of the hardest things I have done in my life!  There have been multiple instanaces during the last two weeks where I have come back from the brink, taken a breath and moved along.  I tend to be stubborn, "Never Quit" has always been an internal mantra in my life.

When I climbed Denali I woke up on summit day, freezing in a tiny tent at 17,000 feet.  One thing about sleeping at 17,000 ft, your body can't burn calories, it starts to burn muscle.  If you are not strong getting to 17,000 feet, spending the night will not recharge your batteries, you will be weaker in the morning. So, I woke up after a terrible night already feeling weak.  I told my climbing partner I couldnt continue, I was done.  I cried! I has spend 21 days struggling to get to the this point on the mountian, after 6 month of preparations and I just quit.  While my climbing partner got ready and worked on finding another team to summit with I tried to accept my decision and go back to sleep.  Only I couldn't sleep I was in a panic.  All that work, all that preparation, rather than relief I felt panic.

I never give up...

Yet, I just had,

what would this mean,

regret.

Getting ready at 17,000 feet in a 2 man tent, for a summit push, is not easy and takes time. After what seemed like an eternity of berating myself, my mouth opened. Words came out that I didnt know I was saying. To this day those words have been the some of the greatest in my life.  I told my climbing partner I have to continue, I have to try to summit, if he'd let me I would like to go.  After 16 hours, 4 hours past the time we should have, we were right back where I said those words. Only I was now at that fucking tiny tent able to say "I did it!"  I didnt think, I just did, one step six breaths one more step.
