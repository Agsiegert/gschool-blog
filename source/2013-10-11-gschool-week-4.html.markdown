<H1><b> Sacrifices </b></H1>

<H3><b> Retrospective </b></H3>
<p>
<b>What were your takeaways from Focus Week? What do you understand better now than you did a week ago? What did you practice but still not master?</b>

What a week, well needed and well planned.  While I have had some wins I started the week with a plan to "Get the basics."  Katrina had the same plan for us and really brought it home during all the exercises and discussions. While I still don't feel like I have mastered anything, I definitely have a working knowledge with a solid base.

<b>What were the pluses and minuses of learning in a small, similar-skill-level group? Would you want to be broken up into small groups for the whole 24 weeks?</b>

The small group format was very helpful in this situation. It was nice to know I was not the only one not getting it. And I did not mind speaking up and putting on the breaks more often to review and insure I was getting the idea.  I didn't mind because I didn't worry about holding anyone back or wasting anyones time.  However, I do not think this style of class would be as helpful as meeting in the whole group.  One of the most amazing things about gSchool has been the collaboration.  Those who know help and those who don't know get the help they need.  I have been thoroughly impressed by everyone's willingness to help and find it helpful for both parties and even helpful for those that might be eavesdropping and learn something. I have benefited several times from these indirect conversations.

<b>How are you feeling about starting web applications next week? What do you think will be hard about it? What's exciting?</b>

I am pretty excited.  I decided to not follow directions and built Web_Guesser yesterday afternoon.  I needed a break and to try something different.  I also tend to have the one computer that doesn't load a gem or some key piece and get left behind while just getting the setup complete.  So I started the tutorial and got stuck.  After about 20 minutes I figured out my error and was able to keep the number from changing each time I refreshed the screen.  Success!  I kept moving along and each time I was able to figure out how to make it work.  It was really gratifying and kept me going.  I was excited to show the game to my son, but was not quite finished until after bedtime.  So, my wife got to play the game first. The fact that I could share something visual with my family was a great feeling.  Its a simple game and program but its something tangible, something I can show my family, something to show them what I am doing, why I am spending so much time away, why I am asking for their sacrifices. And I know my son will think its pretty cool, when he gets to play Web_Guesser tonight.
