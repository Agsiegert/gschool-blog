* **For this project, groups are taking a more serious approach to project management. How does that work with your style? Does it make you feel more organized or like you're wasting a lot of time?**

  I am enjoying have a laid out plan for the project. The big picture helps me gauge the progress and feel less stressed out about deadlines and requriements.

* **What's been hard, interesting, or surprising about building upon someone else's code base?**
  Programming is such an art form, each code base solves the problem but in different way. I was surprised to see just how difference

* **With the class just past the halfway mark, how do you feel about your progress? Do you feel like your momentum is building or waning?**


* **What did you think about the Young Entrepreneurs project we kicked off yesterday?**
