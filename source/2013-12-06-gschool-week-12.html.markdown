# TITLE #

* **For this project, groups are taking a more serious approach to project management. How does that work with your style? Does it make you feel more organized or like you're wasting a lot of time?**

  I am enjoying have a laid out plan for the project. The big picture helps me gauge the progress and feel less stressed out about deadlines and requirements.

* **What's been hard, interesting, or surprising about building upon someone else's code base?**

  Programming is such an art form, each code base solves the problem but in different way. I was surprised to see just how different similar to same outcomes can be implemented.

* **With the class just past the halfway mark, how do you feel about your progress? Do you feel like your momentum is building or waning?**

  Struggle, just when I think I am getting it I am tested in a new way and not quite sure...

* **What did you think about the Young Entrepreneurs project we kicked off yesterday?**

  It is a pleasure to see the enthusiasm and drive of these kids.  It reminded me of myself and am a bit jealous of their opportunity at such a young age. The excitement and energy of not only the kids but their "Teachers/mentors" was good to see and I am really excited for all these kids to succeed.
