#Base#


*56 days from now the program will be over.*

* **What are your big goals during that time?**
  Big goals are to fill in the holes I feel I have in my programing knowledge.  It feels a bit like Swiss cheese at the moment.  I know a little about a lot and I am becoming more proficient in more topics.  However, I feel my foundation is a bit shaky and needs more work.  While I am functional and able to create, I am not overly impressed with the final code product.  Especially, since I have begun reading POODR.  I know I have a lot of work to do and this career will involve lifelong learning, I am excited for that but want to have a better base to build on.

* **What milestones can you lay out between now and the end?**

  The Assessments and Projects seem like natural milestones and I will be working towards those/with those time lines. Additionally, Katrina has setup some one on one time to help us with our base and I have been excited to work on those exercises and building.

* **What are the biggest blockers to your success?**

  It is hard not being the smartest person in the room.  When you base your past performance on a feeling like that, it is very humbling when you have so much to learn.  I am not yet sure I will gain that feeling in this field but I also think that is what I like most about the field.  My biggest blockers are all the things I want to learn.  If I spend too much time on those topics, it is less time I have to build my base.  It has been a juggling act to find the time for the minimums required of school, family and all the other topics, languages and ideas I want to learn during this time. I tend to wander with my interests and I am working to reign the wanderlust and focus on the requirements to solidify my foundation of knowledge. (That was vague, some examples are: DevOps, jQuery, Cryptography, Go, Arduino, Design and type set to name a few.)

* **What parts of your personality/makeup will you have to control to achieve your best outcomes?**

  Focus, as stated above staying focused will be key.  Sticking to building my base foundation and building on that rather than following other threads of interest.

* **What concrete systems will help you get where you want to be?**

  I have been building an exercise plan and training schedule.  I am signed up for the Military Spartan Race at Ft Carson in May.  I have also been riding a bike to school when the weather is decent (above 40 and dry.) Exercise tends to settle me and help me focus and stay more alert.  I know this about my self and nothing like the New Year to reclaim my goals and get motivated. Not to mention the commitment of one of the toughest races I have completed in the past to work towards once again. Not only building my base mentally at school but physically rebuilding my base as well.
