<H1><b> Keep Up </b></H1>

<H3><b> Retrospective </b></H3>

<ol>

<li>How does building web applications, so far, compare to building command-line applications?</li>

Adding another layer to a shaky foundation is never a good idea.  However the immediate visual feedback has been awesome and helped my change and tweek as needed.  It has been pretty good over all , though I am really confused how to test it all.  Hopefully we will work more on this later.

<li>Have you been able to keep up the good habits you practiced during Focus Week, or did you have to make compromises? Why?</li>

Habits, what habits, I don't got no stinking habits...

<li>Is working on an individual project proving or disproving your understanding of your skills? Has having a small team around you been helpful?</li>

Working individually has been really helpful on this particular project, especially with the support of a well rounded team to ask questions and work through problems.  I have not utilized my team as much as maybe I should have this week as I was mostly trying to understand what was happening in the tutorial and everything is basically there to get it done. WOrking through the tutorial myself has really helped me understand better and not feel like I am holding anyone back or just going through the motions trying to "keep up". I am planning to utilize my team more next week as I dive into the extensions section of the project.

<li>Next week we'll have our first assessments. What will be your weak spots, and what will be strong?</li>
I feel like I can read code and understand what it is doing.  My weakness is still getting an idea out of my head and writing code.  Its a big leap and I hope to spend the weekend working on fundamentals, further cementing my understanding and adding to my quiver of syntax.
</ol>

The pace of this project has been really good and felt I have had time to stop what I am doing and research topics I don't fully understand.  This has been really helpful and felt like I was learning this week rather than trying to "keep up".
